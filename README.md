## Medical Clinic Management Project in Java
This project was developed as a practical assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course, focusing on the management of a Medical Clinic. Implemented in Java, the system aims to provide an integrated and object-oriented approach for efficiently handling patients, doctors, medications, and consultations.

## Course and Students
- **Course:** GSI015 - Object-Oriented Programming 1.

- **Students:** Anna Clara Peres, Jo√£o Victor Farchi, Nicolas Mendes, and Pedro Miguel de Paula.

## Main Features
1. **Registration of Patients, Doctors, and Medications:**
   - The system allows for complete registration of information related to patients, doctors, and medications, following an object-oriented approach with classes and encapsulation to ensure data integrity.

2. **Real-Time Consultations:**
   - A key feature of the system is the ability to conduct real-time consultations, enabling interaction between patients and doctors.

3. **Security in Secretary Creation:**
   - To create a secretary profile, a specific system access password is required. The access password is: **_senhaboot123_**. This measure aims to ensure security and access control within the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java

- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:** Abstract Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

- **Data Structures:** ArrayList, HashMap

- **Date Handling:** Date, Calendar, SimpleDateFormat

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the source code using a compatible Java environment.

3. Run the program and follow the instructions to use the available features, such as registering patients, doctors, and medications, as well as performing real-time consultations.
